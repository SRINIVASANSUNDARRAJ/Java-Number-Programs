## **Example Problem**  
### **Check if a Number is Prime**  
**Problem:** Write a Java program to check if a number is prime.  

**Solution:**  
```java
public class PrimeChecker {
    public static boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 29;
        System.out.println(isPrime(number) ? "Prime" : "Not Prime");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**  
- The program checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
